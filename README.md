## Topics

Some topics are handled via git branches. Clone this project, and use `git checkout` in order to use them.

Not all topics are addressed during one of my related codelabs. Checkmarks are here to tell you want we will do during the one your are attending.

**NB:** all dependencies should be handled in the master branch. Therefore, you'll need to run `npm install` only once, juste after cloning the project.

## Angular CLI doc

This project was, of course, generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7 and has been regularly updated since.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
